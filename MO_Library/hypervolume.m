function hv = hypervolume(F, AU, U, N)
% HYPERVOLUME Approximates the hypervolume of a Pareto frontier. First, it  
% generates random samples in the hypercuboid defined by the utopia and  
% antiutopia points. Second, it counts the number of samples dominated by 
% the frontier.  The hypervolume is approximated as the ratio 
% 'dominated points / total points'.
% Please notice that the choice of the utopia and antiutopia points is
% crucial: using points very far from the frontier will result in similar
% hypervolume even for very different frontiers (if the utopia is too far 
% away, the hypervolume will be always low; if the antiutopia is too far 
% away, the hypervolume will be always high). 
% Also, frontier points "beyond" the reference points will not be counted 
% for the approximation (e.g., if the antiutopia is above the frontier or 
% the utopia is below, the hypervolume will be 0).

%    INPUT
%     - F  : the Pareto frontier to evaluate
%     - AU : antiutopia point
%     - U  : utopia point
%     - N  : number of samples for the approximation

%    OUTPUT
%     - hv : hypervolume
